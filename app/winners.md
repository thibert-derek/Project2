Belize’s Pok Ta Pok team Ek’ Balam won their first game in the annual Pok Ta Pok World Championship tournament – Copa Mundial Pelota MesoAmericana Kuzkatan 2019 which is being held this year in El Salvador. And it was a huge win which can be described as a beating and a lashing against Guatemala.

Ek’ Balam and the Embassy of Belize in El Slavador announced that Ek’ Balam won their first game at a final score of 93-0 against Guatemala. They have in effect showed Guatemala who is boss in the ancient Maya ball game called Pok Ta Pok. Belizeans have enough reasons to be proud.

It was in 2017 that Ek’ Balam won the Pok Ta Pok World Championship and this year they have already begun to reclaim their victory.
